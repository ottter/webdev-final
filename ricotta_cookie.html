                <ol>
                    <li><span>1.</span><p>In a mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking soda and salt for 20 seconds, set aside. <br><br></p></li>
                    <li><span>2.</span><p>In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment whip
                        together butter, granulated sugar and lemon zest until pale and fluffy (scrape down sides and
                        bottom of bowl occasionally throughout entire mixing process).<br><br></p></li>
                    <li><span>3.</span><p>Mix in ricotta and vanilla extract then blend in eggs one at a time. Set mixer
                        on low speed and slowly add in flour mixture and mix until combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap
                        and chill 2 hours or up to 2 days. Preheat oven to 350 degrees during last 20 minutes of dough chilling.<br><br></p></li>
                    <li><span>4.</span><p>Scoop chilled dough out 1 Tbsp at a time and shape into balls (if it's too sticky
                        just drop onto sheet using two spoons), drop onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a
                        silicone baking mat (I don't recommend using dark non-stick pans for this recipe since the bottoms
                        will already become pretty golden. Dark pans brown more than uncoated pans do).<br><br></p></li>
                    <li><span>5.</span><p>Bake in preheated oven 12 - 14 minutes until underside of cookies are golden.
                        Cool on baking sheet several minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. <br><br></p></li>
                    <li><span>6.</span><p>Once cool dip tops of cookies in glaze and return to wire rack, immediately add sprinkles
                        if using. Allow glaze to set at room temperature. Store in an airtight container in a single layer.<br><br></p></li>
                    <li><span>7.</span><p>For the Glaze: In a mixing bowl whisk together powdered sugar, melted butter, lemon juice
                        or almond extract, vanilla and 4 Tbsp milk until smooth, adding in more milk 1 tsp at a time to thin
                        as needed (you don't want it to be very thin, it should be quite a bit thicker than a doughnut glaze).<br><br></p></li>
